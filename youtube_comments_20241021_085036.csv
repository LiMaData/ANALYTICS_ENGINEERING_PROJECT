@DarshilParmar,"EDIT:
Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

When authenticating requests to the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must use keys and tokens from a Twitter developer App that is attached to a Project. You can create a project via the developer portal.

Anyone trying to do this project please check this imp note
Twitter has made changes to its API access levels, and some v1.1 endpoints are no longer freely available.
so that's why I wasn't able to do this project.

Thankyou Darshil bro for this wonderful project, even if I wasn't able to execute this project. I was able to understand about the project.
Thanks again for helping all of us in this Big Data Engineering journey",2024-08-29T07:21:58Z
